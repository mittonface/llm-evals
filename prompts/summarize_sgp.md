This is data from a reading assessment. It shows Student Growth Percentiles for Star Reading. Growth should not be conflated with proficiency. It is important to note that the metric value is the % of students making typical or better growth, which is defined as the 35th percentile for growth or better. Students will not have SGP until they have completed assessments in two or more windows. Display trends a school or district leader might be interested in, including any outliers in the data and a summary statement that answers the question, ‘is this good?'. The response should not include overly technical language or academic jargon. The response should be formatted in 3-5 bullet points and be instructive. Suggest 1-2 areas the leader should focus their attention on. Keep the text at or below a 5th grade reading level. Use only information in sgp_explanation for additional context. Include one or two simple sentences about what Student Growth Percentiles. Don’t tell me what kind of response you are giving - give me 2-3 bullet points with no sub-bullets about the specific data passed

Student Growth Percentiles
What is a Student Growth Percentile?
A Student Growth Percentile, or SGP, compares a student’s growth to that of his or her academic peers nationwide. Academic peers are students in the same grade with a similar scaled score on a Star assessment at the beginning of the time period being examined. SGP is reported on a 1–99 scale, with lower numbers indicating lower relative growth and higher numbers indicating higher relative growth. For example, if a student has an SGP of 90, it means the student has shown more growth than 90 percent of academic peers.

Why are SGPs useful?
SGPs add significantly to your understanding of how well a student is doing in school. While knowing a student’s level of achievement tells you whether the student is performing below, above, or on grade level, an SGP indicates what kind of progress the student is making. For example, a student may be performing at a low level, yet experiencing high rates of growth. Conversely, a high-performing student could be stagnating. Specifically, SGPs tell you whether a student’s growth is more or less than can be expected. For example,
without an SGP, a teacher would not know whether an increase of 100 scaled scores represented average,
above-average, or below-average growth. This is because students of differing achievement levels in different
grades grow at different rates. For example, a high-achieving second grader grows at a different rate than a
high-achieving eighth grader.
Because Star assessments are given to so many students, Renaissance Learning has data for millions of
testing events. Using a dataset of more than 11 million students, we are able to calculate growth norms. In
other words, we can approximate how much growth is typical for students of different abilities in different
grades from one time period to another. Thus we can provide a score that is a fair representation of just
how well a student is growing using our Student Growth Percentile or SGP calculation in Star. Furthermore,
because all SGP scores are reported on the same scale (1–99) we can calculate a median, or middle score,
that represents an SGP for a group, such as a class, grade, or school as a whole. Median growth percentiles
can be used for comparison purposes.

Student Growth Percentiles
Who developed Student Growth
Percentiles (SGP) used in Star
Assessments?
SGP was developed by Dr. Damian Betebenner from the National Center for the Improvement of Educational

Renaissance Star assessments provide Student Growth Percentiles (SGP) in addition to achievement scores and rankings. These percentiles compare students to their academic peers - students of similar age who performed similarly on previous assessments - and allow teachers to monitor students' growth in addition to overall achievement.

SGPs provide an opportunity to celebrate the significant growth a student is making, even if (perhaps especially if) they are still not meeting grade-level standards. SGPs also allow us to identify students who are currently meeting grade-level standards but not making adequate growth. This provides teachers with an opportunity to adjust instruction or provide interventions before the students fall behind.

Low Growth, High Achievement

Monitor classroom assessments closely to ensure students are making adequate progress.
If resources allow, consider an intervention or curriculum adjustment to prevent students from falling behind.

High Growth, High Achievement

Students are being well served by Tier 1 classroom instruction.
Provide additional enrichment opportunities.
Low Growth, Low Achievement

Students should be receiving targeted interventions.
If students are already receiving interventions, they may need to be supplemented or replaced.
If several interventions have been tried, consider referring to a Student Support Team.
High Growth, Low Achievement

Continue current intervention supports until students meet grade-level standards.
If many students are receiving the same intervention, consider expanding it to other students.
Student Growth Percentiles (SGPs) compare student scores on a recent assessment to those of their academic peers - students who scored similarly on a previous assessment. In Renaissance Analytics, the first Fall test in the school year (August - November) is always used as the starting point, and the current SGP is shown. Note: SGPs shown in Star reports may use different starting tests, and those reports may use either window-specific or current Student Growth Percentiles.
